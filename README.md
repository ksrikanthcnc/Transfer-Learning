# Transfer Learning of Deep Reinforcement Learning with Atari games

Information regarding project can be found [here](Report.pdf)

### Work Done
Implementation of A3C, DQN, DDQN algorithms
Applying them to variations of Breakout(customizable) and Pong
Comparing the results


### Variotions tested
Pong
Color(Background) Inversion
Screen rotation
Decrease in paddle size
